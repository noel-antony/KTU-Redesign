Redesigning KTU Login Page (Frontend)

The current login page of the KTU portal follows a very minimal and outdated design approach, which negatively impacts usability, accessibility, and overall user experience. While the page serves its functional purpose, several design and UX issues make it feel dull, unengaging, and inconvenient for users.

Issues Observed in the Existing UI

Unappealing Visual Design
The current interface lacks visual hierarchy and modern design elements. The color palette is limited to plain white with a few inconsistent shades of blue, green, and yellow, resulting in a flat and uninspiring appearance.

Poor Responsiveness
The layout does not adapt well to smaller screen sizes. When the viewport width is reduced, the heading text overlaps with the main content area, breaking the layout and reducing readability. This makes the page uncomfortable to use on tablets and mobile devices.

Weak Navigation Bar Design
The navigation bar appears very thin and visually insignificant. It does not stand out as a primary navigation element and lacks proper spacing, making it feel cramped and unintuitive.

Login Panel Behavior
The sign-in window is not visually emphasized. Instead of remaining fixed or centered on the screen, it scrolls away with the page content, which can be confusing for users who expect the login section to remain the focal point.

Content Structure Issues
The main body consists of three sections—Institutions, Students, and University—each followed by a paragraph of text. However, these sections lack clear visual separation and hierarchy, making the content feel dense and less scannable.

Design Goals for the Redesign

The goal of this redesign is to transform the KTU login page into a modern, clean, and user-friendly interface while maintaining simplicity and clarity. The redesign focuses on:

Improving visual hierarchy and layout structure

Enhancing responsiveness across all screen sizes

Creating a clear focal point for the login section

Using a consistent and calming color scheme suitable for an academic portal

Improving readability and accessibility

Making the interface feel more interactive and welcoming without overwhelming the user

Key Improvements in the Redesigned Version

A centered, card-based login section that remains visually prominent

Improved spacing, typography, and alignment for better readability

A cleaner and more consistent color palette with better contrast

Responsive layout that adapts smoothly to smaller devices

Clear separation of content sections using layout and visual cues

A navigation bar that is more visible and balanced within the layout

Conclusion

This redesign focuses on enhancing the overall user experience by addressing the usability and design limitations of the existing KTU login page. By prioritizing clarity, responsiveness, and modern UI principles, the redesigned interface aims to provide a more intuitive and pleasant experience for students, institutions, and university staff accessing the portal.
